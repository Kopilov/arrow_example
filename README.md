# Arrow data example
This C++ program generates some data in [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) format.
Made for https://github.com/Kotlin/dataframe unit tests.

or `run_native.sh` (with sudo, cmake and g++ installed, software will be installed to your local system â€” execute `clean_native.sh` to remove)
to build and execute the example.
